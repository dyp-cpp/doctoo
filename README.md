The (unofficial) C++ Standard draft LaTeX sources DOCumentation and TOOling project

The C++ Standard drafts are interim work materials for the ISO/IEC C++ Standard 14882.
They're currently maintained in LaTeX, publicly available via from the [cplusplus/draft github repository](https://github.com/cplusplus/draft).

The aims of the DocToo project are:

  * simplify the processing and creation of tools that operate on the LaTeX sources
  * collect information about existing tools
  * provide additional information about the LaTeX sources
